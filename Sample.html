        HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia

        HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as 
        headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written 
        using angle brackets. Tags such as  and  directly introduce content into the page. Other tags 
        such as surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. 
        Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
        HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and 
        content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), 
        former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit 
        presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the  element, in collaboration with javascript.
